# Updated Project Spec:

## General Description:
This app will be an interactive way to explore native or local plants at a park in Ames, IA. The app will allow the user to search for native/local plants they encounter by using an image search. This app is intended to help those who are interested in the plants they encounter in their local environment but are unaware of plant specifics needed for a direct search, such as the plant or species names.

Since all of Central Iowa is located entirety within the USDA Hardiness Zone 5b, any plants found within Ames should result in the same native/local options, so users would be able to use this app at any of the parks in Ames or surrounding areas.

Once the user inputs the image of the plant they want to identify, the app will generate a data response that will include the identifying plant information such as the common plant name, species name, short description of general and planting information, if the plant poses any threat to the user, ect. This data will be generated using the Perenual API database and visuals will be generated with TKInter GUI.

Users will also be able to filter this data depending on specific information they are most interested in and could potentially ‘save’ or ‘favorite’ certain plant searches they want to look into further.

## Task Vignette:

### 1.	User Input (photo search)

Carla finds a new plant she is unfamiliar with on a walk in the park by her new home. She uses the TAKE A PHOTO feature on the main screen of the app to take a photo of the plant. The app uses this image to generate the identifying information. A loading status bar appears on screen before text response appears.

Details for later:
 - The app could take a photo within the app OR have a image added from the phone’s gallery/photos folder


### 2.	Plant Identification

After the photo is added to the app, the identifying information appears on screen. Carla is able to find out the name of the plant, some basic features to help identify it, if the plant is poisonous or not, along with a longer, detailed description of the plant. 

The information appears as a category list that includes subheadings and the description below them for an organized reading experience. Colors may be used to differentiate the subheads from the body copy.

The screen includes a filter icon in the top right corner of the screen to ‘jump’ to specific information. Otherwise, the text field can be navigated by a scroll text feature.

Details for later:
 - Should this also mention a save icon if added later on?
 - Screen should include a thumbnail image of the original plant photo to use as reference


### 3.	User Input (current location) 

Carla is a new resident to Iowa and Ames more specifically. She recently moved here from West Texas and is curious about the different range of native plants Iowa has in comparison to the West Texas desert. 

She opens the app and inputs her updated location for better search results. Clicking on LOCATION she is able to input ‘Ames, Iowa’ into a search bar, and clicks SAVE button. Alternatively, she could enter the zip code instead.

Details for later:
 - Could this access the maps feature for geo-location?
 - Result could generate a basic map as the location page image after input

I am not sure if I would be able to fulfill this task, but I think I would still like to keep it as an option since my photo recognition tasks are coming along well so far. If I have time, I would like to include this one as well.
